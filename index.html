        My name is
        <b>Chinonye Ibeakanma</b>
        and i love technology I love technology because it’s the triumph of the
        human intellect. The more I study and understand technology, the more I
        feel that nothing in the universe is out of reach. There’s even a great
        rush of power that comes from coding your first simple “Hello World”
        program. Getting it to run successfully, seeing those two words on the
        screen and knowing that YOU put them there just makes you
        <i>think of the endless possibilities…</i>

        I have learnt
        <b>CSS fundamentals</b>
        like the box model, cascade and specificity, flexbox, grid and z-index.
        And, along with these fundamentals, I have also learnt about functions,
        color types, gradients, logical properties and inheritance to make me a
        well-rounded front-end developer, ready to take on any user interface.
        CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user
        experience. Without CSS,
        <i>websites</i>
        would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In
        addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and
        more.

        <i>Padding</i>
        - The inner space between the content and the border of your box.
        <b>WHILE</b>
        <i>Border</i>
        - The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a
        thick colored line like the green one pictured above.
        <b>WHILE</b>
        <i>Margin</i>
        - The outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.
